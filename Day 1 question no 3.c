The main() function in a C program serves as the entry point for execution. It is where the program starts running. Here’s why main() is important:

Key Purposes of main():

1. Starting Point: The operating system calls the main() function when the program starts.


2. Execution Flow: All other functions are called directly or indirectly from main().


3. Return Value: It typically returns an integer (usually 0 for success), which signals the program’s exit status to the operating system.


4. Program Logic: The core logic and function calls are usually controlled from main().



Syntax:

int main() {
    // Program statements
    return 0;
}

Return Values:

Returning 0 usually indicates successful execution.

Returning a non-zero value indicates an error.
