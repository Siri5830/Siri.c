The #include <stdio.h> directive in a C program is used to include the Standard Input-Output (I/O) Library in your program.

Role of #include <stdio.h>:

1. Input/Output Operations:
The primary role of #include <stdio.h> is to provide functions for input and output operations. For example:

printf() for outputting data to the console.

scanf() for taking input from the user.


Without this library, you would not be able to use these functions in your program.


2. Standard Definitions:
It also defines various constants and macros, such as NULL, EOF, etc., that are commonly used in C programming.



Common Functions from stdio.h:

printf(): Prints formatted output to the console.

scanf(): Reads formatted input from the console.

getchar(): Reads a single character from the standard input.

putchar(): Writes a single character to the standard output.


Example Usage:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 5;

    // Output using printf
    printf("The value of num is: %d\n", num);

    // Input using scanf
    int input;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &input);

    printf("You entered: %d\n", input);

    return 0;
}

Why is it necessary?

Without #include <stdio.h>, the compiler wouldn't know what printf or scanf are, leading to errors.

It is a standard practice to include this header at the beginning of your C programs for input and output functionality.
